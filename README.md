# Unity ScriptTemplates
Generic script templates used in my Unity projects. This repository is intended for use as a submodule to another Git repository housing a Unity project, placed in the /Assets/ScriptTemplates directory.

## Dependencies
[unity-contracts](https://github.com/ocreeva/unity-contracts):
Without the Editor scripts in unity-contracts, the templates in this repository contain tokens which will not be replaced, resulting in invalid script files.
